![VMware Workstation Pro is now available for personal use at no cost, but the integration with Broadcom is still a messy affair, to put it down mildly.](/assets/img/2024-05-15-VMwareWorkstationFusionProNowFreeforPersonalUse_0.png)

To help others who may have encountered difficulties navigating Broadcom’s site to download VMware Fusion or Workstation Pro, I’ve noted down these steps for a more direct approach. Hopefully, it’ll help streamline the process for those who, like me, found themselves lost in the maze of menus hiding the download link.

- Go to [broadcom.com](https://www.broadcom.com)
- In the upper right corner, select ‘Support Portal’
- Either log in by clicking ‘Go To Portal’ or ‘Register’ for a basic Broadcom account Quick link to the registration form
- Once logged in, go to [support.braodcom.com](https://support.broadcom.com) if you’re not redirected there
- Click the dropdown to choose the VMware Cloud Foundation division
- On the left, click ‘My Downloads’
- Search for either Fusion or Workstation
- Click the product name (VMware Fusion or VMware Workstation Pro )
- Notice the dropdown for the Personal Use edition (it is the exact same binaries as the Commercial one)
- Select 17.5.2 or 13.5.2
- Download and install
